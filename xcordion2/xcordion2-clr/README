To build the C# stuff you'll need to install NMaven:

	http://nmaven.codeplex.com/

Get the source zip file, unpack and run "mvn install" in the root.

You'll also need a C# compiler, of course. :-)

Note to posterity: the project directory was first created using: 
	mvn archetype:create -DarchetypeGroupId=org.sonatype.nmaven.csharp -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-class-library -DarchetypeVersion=0.17 -DgroupId=org.xcordion -DartifactId=xcordion2-clr
